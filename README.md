# AzureDevOpsBattlefield

In my quest to learn Azure DevOps and unravel the complexities behind features like templates and runtime expressions, I sought to develop a simple mental model. However, I soon discovered that there is no such straightforward model. Instead, understanding Azure DevOps requires memorizing numerous details and delving into implementation intricacies.

The abstraction in Azure DevOps is like the magic depicted in Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings. It may seem well-described and intellectually graspable, but true comprehension slips through our fingers. Massive abstraction leaks necessitate knowledge of implementation specifics and awareness of countless corner cases.

In this repository, you'll find a wealth of tested examples and living documentation that unveils the intricacies of Azure DevOps.
